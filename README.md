# OpenCV Tracking Projects

This repository contains three small computer vision projects using Python and OpenCV. Each notebook demonstrates a specific technique for tracking motion or objects in video.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Motion Tracking with OpenCV
**Notebook**: `Motion_Tracking_opencv.ipynb`  
This project showcases basic motion detection using frame differencing techniques. It tracks movement by analyzing the difference between consecutive frames in a video.

**Highlights:**
- Background subtraction
- Contour detection
- Frame differencing for motion detection

**Use Case:** Ideal for surveillance systems or simple motion-triggered actions.



### 2. Enhanced Car Tracking 2 (Improved Version)
**Notebook**: `Car_Tracking_opencv 2.ipynb`  
An improved version of the previous car tracking notebook with better visualization and possibly optimized detection accuracy. Enhancements may include better frame management or visualization tools.

**Highlights:**
- Improved visualization techniques
- Optimized frame processing (e.g., resizing, grayscale)
- Performance tweaks

**Use Case:** Better suited for more polished or real-time demo applications.

### 3. Car Tracking 1 with OpenCV
**Notebook**: `Car_Tracking_opencv.ipynb`  
This project focuses on vehicle detection and tracking using Haar cascade classifiers. It detects cars in video frames and keeps count of detected objects.

**Highlights:**
- Pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for cars
- Object detection in real-time video
- Vehicle tracking visualization

**Use Case:** Suitable for basic traffic monitoring and vehicle counting applications.
